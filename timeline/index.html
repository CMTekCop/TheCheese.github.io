        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>A greek named Archytas mystified and amused the citizens of the city of Tarentum by flying a pigeon made of wood. Escaping steam propelled the bird suspended on wires. This was the first documented use of rocket like technology in history. The pigeon used the action-reaction principle, which was not stated as a scientific law until the 17th century.</p>

          <p>An aeolipile, also known as a Hero's engine, is a simple bladeless radial steam turbine which spins when the central water container is heated. Torque is produced by steam jets exiting the turbine, much like a tip jet or rocket engine. It was attributed to the mathematician and engineer Hero of Alexandria for its creation. </p>

          <p>German fireworks maker Johann Schmidlap invents the two-stage rocket to reach higher altitudes. A large skyrocket (first stage) carries a smaller rocket (second stage). This had revolutionised rocket technology, as all later rockets are built on a multi-stage principle, exluding the shuttle, of course. </p>

        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>The success of Indian rocket barrages against the British in 1792 and again in 1799 caught the interest of an artillery expert, Colonel William Congreve. Congreve set out to design rockets for use by the British military. The Congreve rockets were highly successful in battle, especially in the war of 1812. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>The next revolutionary invention in the field of rocket development was done by british scientist William Hale, who developed a technique called spin stabilization. In this method, the escaping exhaust gases struck small vanes at the bottom of the rocket, causing it to spin much as a bullet does in flight. Variations of the principle are still used today.</p>

In 1946, with the help of captured German rocket engineers, the United States begins using V-2 rockets as sounding rockets to make measurements of the atmosphere at high altitudes.</p>

          <p>On October 4, 1957, the world was stunned by the news of an Earth-orbiting artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union. Called Sputnik I, the satellite was the first successful entry in a race for space between the two superpower nations. Less than a month later, the Soviets followed with the launch of a satellite carrying a dog named Laika on board. Laika survived in space for seven days.</p>
